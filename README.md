# Substance-Logger

This program is made so substance users can log their experience. The purpose of this program is so that new and experienced substance users can share and learn from these reports.

The goal of this program is to log substance use and experience with ease for those who are mentally incapable (due to substance) as well as those capable.

"Even your grandma can use this program!" should be the get-go thought when using this program.
